Project Summary
---------------

``distrrr`` and ``pydistrrr`` are R and Python packages respectively
that calculate distance metrics between vectors. Users can find closest
distances based either on a threshold distance or specified number of
outputs to find vectors that are similar to their input. These functions
are designed to be similar to `Scikit Learnâ€™s Nearest Neighbors`_
functionality.

Alignment with Python / R Ecosystems
------------------------------------

There are existing packages that implement the same proposed
functionality in both Python and R (listed below). Most of these
packages provide functions to calculate different distance metrics
between observations and/or also extend the functionality to compute the
k closest neighbors (KNN) of a given point based on a selected distance
metric.
